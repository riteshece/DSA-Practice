// how many inputs/parameters does pop and concat method/function take
// are pop and concat function mutable or immutable
// what is the output of pop and concat method
// are pop and concat method higher order function. Why or why not
 

Pop:
1. Pop dont take any input.
2. It is mutable because it removes last element from array.
3. Output of the pop is whatever left after deleting the last element of the array.
4. No, because it doesn't take input or output as a function. 
 
 
 
Concat:-
1. It takes two inputs
2. It is immutable 
3. Merged array is the output. 
4. No, because it doesn't take input or output as a function.


Higher-Order Function. Function are treated as a variable that can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument. Function receives another function as an argument or returns First-order a new function or both. The “first-class” concept only has to do with functions in programming languages
